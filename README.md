# SUKMA APPLICATION
## Description
SUKMA is a website in the field of education that contains education about bullying. We created this website with the porposed of increasing youth awareness of the high number of bullying that is very prevalent, especially in the world of education in Indonesia. The unique thing about the SUKMA website is that educational content is presented in the form of a Flashcard feature which users can save and delete later, because we focus on target users who are teenagers aged 12 -17 years, so they will not feel bored when using our website. Of course, we hope that with the launch of SUKMA, we can increase awareness to many people and can reduce the number of bullying in Indonesia, especially in the world of education.
