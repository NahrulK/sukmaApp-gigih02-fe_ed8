## Description

SUKMA is a website in the field of education that contains education about bullying. We created this website with the purposed of increasing youth awareness of the high number of bullying that is very prevalent, especially of education in Indonesia. The unique thing about the SUKMA website is that educational content is presented in the Flashcard feature which users can later save and delete, because we focus on target users who are teenagers aged 12 -17 years, so they will not feel bored when using our website. Of course, we hope that with the launch of SUKMA we can increase awareness to many people and can reduce the number of bullying in Indonesia, especially in education. This website was originally created by the <strong> Sukma Team FE_ED8 </strong> with the mentor <strong> Dion Edo Fananie </strong> which consists of:

1. Erryck Norrys (KM_G2FE3068)
2. Luthfiah Ananda Putri (KM_G2FE6240)
3. Nahrul Khayatullah (KM_G2FE3027)
4. Shafa Salsabila Pribadi (KM_G2FE4040)
5. Merina (KM_G2FE5287) (Tidak Berkontribusi dalam Capstone Project)
